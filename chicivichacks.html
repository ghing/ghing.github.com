        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>##chicivichacks is an IRC channel hosted on the <a href="http://freenode.net/" title="FreeNode">FreeNode</a> 
           network.  It is meant to be a virtual meeting place for Civic Hackers in Chicago, Illinois and their communities.</p>
        <p>Possible uses for this channel:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Virtual coworking for freelance workers</li>
          <li>Organizing ad-hoc coworking or meetups</li>
          <li>Brainstorming project ideas and finding collaborators</li>
          <li>Sanity checking code and project ideas</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>For the last year, I've been working as a freelance developer on a <a href="http://floodlightproject.org/" title="Floodlight">community storytelling project</a>.
           While I enjoy the flexibility of freelance work, I miss the comraderie and mental kickstart of a work place.
           There are lots of awesome meetups that touch on civic hacking, but I found it difficult to be an active
           participant in these because of work, family obligations and non-tech interests. I wanted to create a lightweight,
           ad-hoc space for interacting with other civic technologists in Chicago that could be accessible to people
           with restricitons like me, and also help mesh together various civic hacking projects and communities
           across resources and geography.</p>
        <h2>Civic hacking</h2>
        <p>While I imagine this channel will be used chiefly by technologists; grassroots organizers, urban planners,
           designers, journalists, researchers, educators ... might also find a space here.</p>
